# project_seven_wonders
The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.
The app we created lets users: 

view some educational content on a chosen topic
interact with the page to move through different sections of content
Extensions:

We created Mongo DB to store information.
We use charts and maps to display the information to the page.

From the home page the user can go to Info or Game section of the app. The Info section lets the user view Map (leaflet) with markers of all 7 wonders. If the user clicks on the particular marker, the app will display the information with the photo.
The Game section displays a question with 4 possible answers. If you answer question correctly, you get 10 points. If you don't, you lose a life. You have 3 lives. If the user answers 10 questions correctly you get 10 extra points. After the user quit the game or lose all lives, the chart will show the user a graph of 3 last games with the points earned.
