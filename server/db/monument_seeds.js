    name: "Colossus of Rhodes",
    longitude: "43.721767",
    latitude: "15.854608",
    details: "A statue of the Greek sun-god Helios, known as the Colossus of Rhodes, can be found on the Greek island of the same name. It was erected by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC to celebrate Rhodes' victory over the ruler of Cyprus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, whose son Demetrius I of Macedon unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in 305 BC. It stood tall for 54 years until it was badly damaged by an earthquake in 226 BC. At 33 metres  high, the Colossus was the tallest statue in the ancient world. Made of bronze and reinforced with iron, it was weighted with stones."

    name: "Great Pyramid of Giza",
    longitude: "29.979495",
    latitude: "31.134266",
    details: "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest Wonder of the Ancient World, and is the only one that has remained almost fully intact. It is located near Giza in Egypt and the building of the structure is thought to have concluded around 2560 BC. It is thought that the structure took 10 to 20 years to complete and was built as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu. Originally built to 481 feet, it was known as the tallest man-made structure, until the Lincoln Cathedral surpassed this in the 1300s. The Pyramid therefore remained the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years. It is thought that the Pyramid was constructed using limestone, granite and mortar. The outside of the pyramid was constructed using the limestone, which created a smooth outer surface of the pyramid. The pyramid had three chambers (that have been discovered). One chamber is unfinished and protrudes down into the bedrock beneath the pyramid. The two other chambers are the Queen's Chamber and the King’s Chamber, which are located higher up in the Pyramid than the unfinished chamber. The King’s Chamber is made completely of Granite."

    name: "Hanging Gardens of Babylon",
    longitude: "35.9689576",
    latitude: "41.642653",
    details: "The Location of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is not definitively known, and it is the only one from the Seven Wonders where the location is not identified. It is rumored that the location was in Iraq, which is where the Ancient City of Babylon was located, but there were a few other cities called Babylon as it meant 'Gate of the Gods', so it may have been located elsewhere. No physical evidence has been found for the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, but the structure has been mentioned in various pieces of writing. It is unknown if these descriptions are purely mythical or if this structure actually existed but was completely destroyed sometime around 1AD. It is unclear as to who built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. One theory suggests it was King Nebuchadnezzar II who built the structure for his wife, and he built it nearby a grand palace which went by the name 'The Marvel of Mankind'. Another theory suggests Queen Semiramis was attributed to the construction of The Hanging Gardens, and the Gardens have been known to go by the name “The Hanging Gardens of Semiramis” for this reason. The name of the structure came from the Greek word kremastós, which means “overhanging”, which was then given the English word of “hanging”. It is thought that this word was used to describe the way that the trees and plants were planted on a raised structure (for example a terrace or in teirs)."

    name: "Lighthouse of Alexandria",
    longitude: "31.213889",
    latitude: "29.885556",
    details: "The Lighthouse of Alexandria, also referred to as the Pharos of Alexandria, was constructed by the Ptolemaic Kingdom, during the reign Ptolemy II Philadelphus (280–247 BC) in what is now known as Egypt. It was thought that the people of Pharos were wreckers, therefore Ptolemy I had the lighthouse built to help guide ships into port at night. Badly damaged by three earthquakes, it was estimated to stand 100 meters tall in its prime. It took twelve years to complete construction and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top, and was said to have been built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. Not only the lighthouse functional but was also of vital strategic importance as summed up in Julius Caesar, in his Civil Wars (Part III, 111–112)."

    name: "Mausoleum at Halicarnassus",
    longitude: "37.0379",
    latitude: "27.4241",
    details: "The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or Tomb of Mausolus was built between 353 and 350 BC at Halicarnassus for Mausolus and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene. The Mausoleum was approximately 45 m (148 ft) in height, and the four sides were adorned with sculptural reliefs. The finished structure of the mausoleum was considered to be such an aesthetic triumph that Antipater of Sidon identified it as one of his Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Mausolos started to plan the tomb before his death, as part of the building works in Halicarnassus, and when he died Artemisia continued the building project. Artemisia spared no expense in building the tomb. She sent messengers to Greece to find the most talented artists of the time. Artemisia died two years after Mausolus, before the tomb was completed. The Mausoleum overlooked the city of Halicarnassus for many years. It was untouched when the city fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC and still undamaged after attacks by pirates in 62 and 58 BC. It stood above the city's ruins for sixteen centuries. It was destroyed by successive earthquakes from the 12th to the 15th century, the last surviving of the six destroyed wonders. The city of Halicarnassus where Mausolus and Artemisia ruled is now known as Bodrum, Turkey. The word mausoleum originates from the name Mausolus. The term mausoleum became the name used for tombs built above ground from that time on."

    name: "Statue of Zeus at Olympia",
    longitude: "37.637861",
    latitude: "21.63",
    details: "The Statue of Zeus was located at the sanctuary of Olympia, in Greece, and erected in the Temple of Zeus there.  It was made by the Greek sculptor Phidias around 435 BC. It was a giant seated figure, about 13 m high. It represented the god Zeus sitting on an elaborate cedar wood throne ornamented with ebony, ivory, gold and precious stones. It was covered of ivory plates and gold panels over a wooden framework. It was lost and destroyed during the 5th century AD with no copy ever being found, and details of its form are known only from ancient Greek descriptions and representations on coins. The statue of Zeus was commissioned by the Eleans, for their recently constructed Temple of Zeus"

    name: "Temple of Artemis at Ephesus",
    longitude: "37.9493601",
    latitude: "27.3616675",
    details: "Sometimes less precisely referred to as the Temple of Diana, The Temple of Artemis was dedicated to the Greek Goddess of the hunt and childbirth. Located in what is now referred to as Turkey, the temple was completely reconstructed three times, it’s final time incarnation achieving it the state of one of the ancient 7 wonders of the world. By 401AD the temple was in ruins.In it’s earliest version the temple was built in the Bronze Age, something Callimachus attributed to the Amazons in his Hymn to Artemis. During the 7th century BC, the temple was destroyed by a flood before being rebuilt by the Cretan architect Chersiphon. Funded by Croesus of Lydia, it took 10 years to complete. This version survived a further 300 years before being destroyed by an act of arson in 356 BC. The next and final form was funded by the Ephesians and mentioned by Antipater of Sidon in his list of the world’s seven wonders. Scholars are unsure how long the building stood before falling to ruin, after the temples closure by Christians. Some parts from the temple were eventually used in construction of other buildings. Some of the columns in Hagia Sophia originally belonged to the temple of Artemis, and the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai records the re-use of several statues and other elements from the temple, throughout Constantinople."
